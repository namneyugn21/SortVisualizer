Then, you pick a card from the unsorted group and put it in the right place in the sorted group. (<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/insertion-sort/" target='_blank'>Source</a>)

      In simple terms, we can say that the process of merge sort is to divide the array into two halves, sort each half, and then merge the sorted halves back together. This process is repeated until the entire array is sorted.
