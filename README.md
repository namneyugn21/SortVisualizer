# SortVisualizer

Welcome to **SortVisualizer**, an interactive web app that brings sorting algorithms to life! Whether you're a coding newbie, an algorithm aficionado, or just curious about how data gets sorted, this project is here to add a bit of color and sound to your learning journey.

## Features
- **Interactive Sorting Visualizations**: Watch how Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, and Selection Sort work in real time.
- **Dynamic Bar Heights**: The bar heights adapt perfectly to the container for an aesthetically pleasing view.
- **Gradient Bars**: Beautiful gradients that make the sorting process visually appealing.
- **Sound Effects**: Enjoy audio feedback for comparisons and swaps.
- **Speed Control**: Adjust the speed of sorting animations to suit your preference.
- **Customizable Input**: Generate arrays of various sizes and observe how different algorithms handle the data.

## Technologies Used
- **React.js**: Building the interactive UI.
- **CSS**: Styling the visualizer and animations.
- **JavaScript**: Implementing sorting algorithms and dynamic rendering.
- **HTML5 Audio**: Adding sound effects to enhance the experience.

## How It Works
1. **Choose an Array Size**: Use the slider to select the number of elements.
2. **Generate Array**: Click the "Generate" button to create a random array.
3. **Pick an Algorithm**: Select Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, or Selection Sort.
4. **Watch the Magic**: Enjoy the animations, gradients, and sounds as the algorithm sorts the array!
